  <h1>"Annabel Lee"</h1>
  <h2>by Edgar Allan Poe</h2>

  <p>It was many and many a year ago,</br>
    In a kingdom by the sea,</br>
    That a maiden there lived whom you may know</br>
    By the name of Annabel Lee;</br>
    And this maiden she lived with no other thought</br>
    Than to love and be loved by me. </p>

  <p> I was a child and she was a child,</br>
    In this kingdom by the sea,</br>
    But we loved with a love that was more than love—</br>
    I and my Annabel Lee—</br>
    With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven</br>
    Coveted her and me. </p>

  <p> And this was the reason that, long ago,</br>
    In this kingdom by the sea,</br>
    A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling</br>
    My beautiful Annabel Lee;</br>
    So that her highborn kinsmen came</br>
    And bore her away from me,</br>
    To shut her up in a sepulchre</br>
    In this kingdom by the sea.</p>

  <p> The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,</br>
    Went envying her and me—</br>
    Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,</br>
    In this kingdom by the sea)</br>
    That the wind came out of the cloud by night,</br>
    Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. </p>

  <p> But our love it was stronger by far than the love</br>
    Of those who were older than we—</br>
    Of many far wiser than we—</br>
    And neither the angels in Heaven above,</br>
    Nor the demons down under the sea</br>
    Can ever dissever my soul from the soul</br>
    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; </p>

  <p> For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams</br>
    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</br>
    And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes</br>
    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;</br>
    And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side</br>
    Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,</br>
    In her sepulchre there by the sea—</br>
    In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>
